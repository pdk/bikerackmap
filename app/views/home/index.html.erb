              This site is one view of a database of bicycle rack/stand locations crowdsourced 
              through <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a>.
              If you would like to contribute to <a href="/map">the map</a>, do this:

              <li> Turn on GPS on your smartphone. (Gotta have this, otherwise cannot put it on the map.)</li>
              <li> Take a photo of a bicycle rack. </li>
              <li> Tweet that photo, with a bit of text about the rack, <a `"https://twitter.com/bicyclerack"><em>@bicyclerack</em></a>. 
                  (If you don't include <a href="https://twitter.com/bicyclerack"><em>@bicyclerack</em></a>, it will not be picked up by our robot.)
          </ol>
